## redmine_courtoisie
Redmine Courtoisie ( courtesy in French ) is a Redmine plugin that adds a button to automatically rewrite issue titles and descriptions to make them more polite, readable, and professional. It leverages AI text generation (Google Gemini) to correct spelling, rephrase text, and enhance politeness while preserving the technical meaning.

Currently it only supports French.
